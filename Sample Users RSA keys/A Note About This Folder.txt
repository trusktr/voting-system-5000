These keys are generated for the sole purpose of system testing. In the proposed scenario in which this system is deployed, this folder would not exist. Voting-System-5000 assumes that each registered voter that wants to vote with this system is issued a Voter ID card that has a public and private RSA key pair, such as the ones here. During voting, this keypair will be entered (manually, or perhaps with a barcode scanner) at the voting kiosk to provide voter authentication and integrity.
